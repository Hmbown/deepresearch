# Example Report Placeholder: RAG Failure Modes

## Executive Summary

This file is a placeholder template that matches the expected deepresearch output structure. It does not contain synthetic experimental results or invented claims. Replace each section with evidence-backed content from an actual run.

## Key Findings

- Placeholder: evaluate retrieval recall/precision before drawing conclusions about grounding quality [1].
- Placeholder: test chunking and indexing strategies with reproducible prompts and traceable outputs [2].
- Placeholder: audit citation fidelity to confirm each generated claim maps to supporting source material [3].

## Contradictions and Uncertainties

- No real benchmark run is represented in this placeholder.
- Failure mode prevalence can vary by domain, corpus freshness, and retriever settings.
- Any operational recommendation should be validated in a task-specific evaluation harness.
